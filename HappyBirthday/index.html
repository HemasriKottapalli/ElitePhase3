        <h3>Hey Kasyap!</h1>
        <p> 
            I know it's way beyond late to say belated happy birthday so i'm not even gonna try! It's neither for your 2023 birthday(near past) nor for your 2024 birthday(near future)! I want you to consider it for your every birthday ever!<br> Because sometimes I wonder if we would be the same after college no matter how much we wanna be! so if there is any such birthday when i can't wish you cuz of any reason,please just read this. You can be totally mad at me for not wishing you but just don't be sad cuz i know you will but you absolutely don't deserve it.<br> You are the most sweetest person i know! You deserve all the happpiness in the world! You never wish any bad to anyone yet somehow end up getting hurt lol i guess it's time you change your nice guy attitude a little bit. You do your best in everything, You're best son i know in this generation, so does best brother, Anu and pranathi akka are lucky to have you! and ofc You're a best friend! I want you to know and realise all theese things and be proud of what a nice person you are, instead of comparing youself with wrong people, and making wrong evaluations of yourself just cuz you haven't find the people who would absolutely adore the person that you are!<br> Seems like i'm saying what i always say even in your wishes card! I just want you to be happy ra! 
            <br> And if you are reading it from future, see ? I was right all those years ago? I hope atleast you realised now (in probably 2040 or something!).
